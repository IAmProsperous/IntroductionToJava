Technically, we need to continue our testing through to contain
tests for the Sudoku Grid and the Sudoku Generator.

However, these tests are complex and would take a great deal of work to write
along with full understanding of the SudokuGenerator class.

Additionally, we are going to be revamping the solution in a couple of sections
to use a full GUI, rather than the standard out for printing and gameplay.

Therefore, as the code required would be somewhat similar and somewhat out of the
scope of this course, and the impending changes to the overall structure of 
Sudoku would make the tests require refactoring to handle the new GUI, we will
skip these tests for now. Feel free to mess around with them on your own, writing
tests to validate the SudokuGrid and SudokuGenerator methods.

Also note: We have to fix the classes to prevent bad input, as noted in the test
for the SudokuGridCell.  We should not be able to accept -1 as a valid value.
How might we go about preventing these bad inputs?
